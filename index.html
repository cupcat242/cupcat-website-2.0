                <p>We are planning to make a blockchain game, where all NFTs from Cupcats (Cupcats, Cupcat houses, and
                    Cupcat Kittens) will be usable in game.</p>
                <p>This game is planned to be played by EVERYONE, but only Cupcat holders will be able to play with
                    their own Cupcats, houses, and kittens as long as they hold them. We already made a deal for this
                    game, game will be made as centralized but will be connected to the blockchain.</p>
                <p>By playing this game, Cupcat holders will be able to earn a gaming token, this token will have
                    liquidity to buy & sell, Cupcat holders will be able to earn this token by playing the game, but a
                    tax will be redacted from every sale to use for marketing purposes. Name of the token is yet to be
                    revealed, we are still thinking about options.</p>
                <p>More details about the gameplay will come after our meetings with our partner game company.</p>

                <p>Right now we are working on our first song for Cath Metal Band. Our producer friend is helping us to
                    realize our dream, and if we cannot find what we are looking for, we will get more help from other
                    professionals.</p>
                <p>Every song made by Cath Metal Band will be a rock or metal song. We are also looking for other ways
                    of utilizing the band. This is being made to show Cupcats to a whole new community.</p>
                <p>If you have any suggestions about Cath Metal Band songs or utility, you can reach out to us from

                    products.</p>
                <p>Building a shop was the first big thing on our roadmap. Many people from our community didn’t agree
                    with us, some left, some didn’t think physical products would be a success. Many of these thoughts
                    are mostly because we couldn’t deliver the message well, so here are some details:
                </p>
                <p>We are not looking to create a shop for Cupcat owners. Our target is creating products for every cat
                    lover, with and without Cupcat designs. We are aiming to create a product line in many different
                    areas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Streetwear (T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets etc.)</li>
                    <li>Home apparel (Pyjamas, bathrobes etc.)</li>
                    <li>Accessories (Hats, backpacks, patches etc.)</li>
                    <li>Plushies and pins</li>
                    <li>Mugs</li>
                    <li>Collectibles</li>
                    <li>...and many more that we will announce on a later date.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>All of the designs will be about cats, and every Cupcat holder will have a lifetime discount on the
                    shop.</p>
                <p>We are also working to make a cryptocurrency pay option. This may or may not become true, so no
                    promises but if we can make this, we will build our shop on multiple chains to provide a better
                    shopping experience.</p>

                <p>Hello everyone, I’m cupkitten. The creator of the Cupcats and the artist at the same time.</p>
                <p>I’m from a developing country. People not living here might think this is a good place to live, a
                    good holiday destination, but in reality I live in a place where women live in fear everyday.</p>
                <p>We wake up to murders, missing women news, abuses and many more stories every day, women normally
                    have rights on paper in my country, but we actually don’t in life. People who kill women mostly
                    don't get sentenced, abuses are never punished, underage marriages are everywhere. I’m not from a
                    place where hijab or burqa is a must, but women who are not wearing it are being judged in many
                    places, and men think not wearing these is an invitation to abuse.</p>
                <p>I live with my boyfriend (husband to be, his nickname is catfish) and we have 4 cats living with us,
                    and we also pay expenses for 2 cats in my family home where I used to live. I also always help stray
                    cats in our streets. I live in a place we can call a “cat neighborhood” and there are hundreds of
                    cats here. I’m doing my best to feed them. My boyfriend didn’t have a bad life, he wasn’t rich but
                    he also wasn’t poor, I learned many things while watching him sitting next to me and researching
                    crypto everyday. He was trying to earn money with his investments so we can get rid of this country
                    and live abroad.</p>
                <p>Things went bad, he lost a lot of money because he tried things he didn’t know, and I know this is a
                    classic in crypto. But we didn’t give up on our dreams, and that’s where I thought maybe I could try
                    making an NFT to change our situation. He supported me when I moved in with him, bought my first
                    graphic tablet. Even though I could work as a nurse, the profession I have a degree from college, he
                    wanted me to follow my passion, and pushed me to become better at something I never found support
                    for.</p>
                <p>I wanted to leave this country, I wanted to save my life, I wanted to save my cats’ and boyfriend’s
                    life. He knew about NFTs and helped me to find the correct way to do it. We asked help from 3 of our
                    friends, unevenpun (developer), Lasalien (Discord builder), and oranJ (video editor), and started a
                    journey where we don’t even know if we can make it happen or not.</p>
                <p>I was drawing, trying to get noticed on Twitter, my boyfriend was trying to use our NFT account and
                    we were trying to at least get some money to help us. This is not a lie, we needed money and that’s
                    why I started to make Cupcats. I was already following some people in my real Twitter account
                    because of my boyfriend, and wanted to make some honoraries for them, both because I love them and
                    also I didn’t know what else we could do, I thought maybe they could at least help us with some
                    knowledge because they all looked like great people.</p>
                <p>I messaged many people, asking for help about understanding what I should do, only CL returned my
                    messages back then. Then I made my first honorary for CL, that was the biggest interaction I ever
                    got, I got hopeful, finished icebergy, and he didn’t even see the honorary I made for him and I got
                    upset. Trying everyday, replying to many tweets hoping to get some to notice me, drawing at the same
                    time, and my boyfriend wasn’t able to help a lot because he was also working so we could live, I got
                    depressed, and an angry reply under Andre Cronje’s tweet turned into something I could never dream
                    of. Andre Cronje retweeted and tweeted about me and Cupcats many times in an hour, people started to
                    rush into our Discord, a lot of people started to follow me and the Cupcats, I was in shock and
                    didn’t even know what to do. We hugged and started crying with my boyfriend, we were looking into
                    our phones, notifications kept coming, it was a dream moment that couldn’t be real or couldn’t be
                    any better.</p>
                <p>And then almost every crypto influencer noticed me, many of them offered help, a lot of people
                    messaged me and offered help, I couldn’t return to everyone because there were hundreds of messages.
                    I still remember that day and I’m still grateful to Andre Cronje and everyone offered help. Without
                    you, I wouldn’t be able to believe in myself and be able to think I could do something people would
                    like.</p>
                <p>Now with the community’s help, we were able to launch Cupcats, I got incredible support from many
                    people, especially from Tetranode and many more other known people in crypto. I want to thank all of
                    them from here, all of them have an honorary and if I missed anyone, please reach me out.</p>
                <p>Thanks to everyone who supported Cupcats and me, people really saved my life and now I want to give
                    back great things in return. That’s why my boyfriend and me are working everyday to make Cupcats
                    bigger, and I hope we can make it so this doesn’t only stay as people helping because of my
                    story.</p>

                <p>As mentioned in our roadmap, we are donating 5% of all the income from Cupcats.</p>
                <p>While starting this project, cupkitten’s main purpose was to leave the country she lives with her
                    cats and give a good life to both herself and her cats, and it’s not limited with that. We want to
                    save as many stray animals as we can.</p>
                <p>We actually wanted to create a cat shelter with our money, but that wasn’t possible with the amount
                    we can spare. We are still aiming to build a cat or animal shelter if we earn anything from the 2nd
                    project but that’s a future aim.</p>
                <p>
                    For now, we are donating in simple amounts, and we want to help as many tiny places as we can to
                    make a difference for stray cats. Here are the places we donated till now.
                <ul>
                    <li>Place 1</li>
                    <li>Place 2</li>

                <p>We are preparing Cupcat houses with Algerian illustrator Ismail Tiffour, and kittens with Turkish
                    illustrator Yaren Kurt.</p>
                <h5>Drop 1: Houses for Cupcats</h5>
                <p>Houses will consist of a lot of things. A theme, a window for cats to look outside, food bowls, cat
                    trees, litter boxes and some other things. This house will also be your home in the Cupcat
                    blockchain game. You will be able to fully interact with everything in your house.</p>
                <p>Our artist for Cupcat houses is Algerian artist Ismail Tiffour. He is known for his incredible
                    landscape illustrations, and he will work with us to create great homes for Cupcats.</p>
                <h5>Drop 2: Kittens</h5>
                <p>Houses won’t be only for Cupcats, all Cupcat owners will also own a kitten. Kittens will have
                    different traits just like Cupcats, they will not have a cup but they will have a bed (or something
                    like a bed) to sit on.</p>
                <p>Sweet kittens will be drawn by Turkish female artist Yaren Kurt. She is a young artist still studying
                    in college, and her expertise is drawing things in a cute way. A perfect match for Cupcats!</p>

                <p>We are creating a mobile game for Cupcats in collaboration with Stratera Games from Turkey.</p>
                <p>Stratera Games is founded by Turkish influencer Dora Özsoy. Dora is known with his narrative and
                    story videos about League of Legends, he’s great at finding easter eggs and other secret things, and
                    creating a narrative around it or finding what those secrets are pointing out.</p>
                <p>Stratera Games is an indie game studio, already launched 5 games and some of them gained a good
                    traction among Turkish players.</p>
                <p>Our mobile game will be their first huge project, equipped with a lot of details. Game will be
                    launched as a single player game with a worldwide leaderboard but we are planning to implement
                    multiplayer in the future.</p>
